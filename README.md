# SPARK - Smart Problem-solving and AI-driven Resource Kit

## Description
**SPARK** is a web platform designed to enhance the coding problem-solving skills of college students. By organizing challenges from various coding platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef, SPARK helps students progress from novice to expert developers. The platform also utilizes AI to suggest personalized problem sets based on skill levels and tracks students' progress through a badge system, fostering a supportive learning environment.

## Key Features

- **Problem-Solving Skill Assessment**  
  SPARK categorizes students into different skill levels and awards them badges (like Rook, Knight, Bishop) based on their problem-solving achievements. This system motivates students to enhance their skills and climb the ranks.

- **AI-Driven Problem Recommendations**  
  Utilizing advanced AI algorithms, SPARK analyzes individual student data to suggest coding problems that align with their skill levels. This ensures that students are challenged appropriately, promoting effective learning without overwhelming them.

- **Progress Tracking Dashboard**  
  The platform features a user-friendly dashboard that displays the number of problems solved by students on LeetCode and CodeChef. This tracking encourages students to stay engaged and helps them visualize their growth over time.

- **Class-Based Recognition**  
  SPARK fosters a sense of community through a class leaderboard that displays student achievements. Rather than ranking students directly, it focuses on encouraging healthy competition through badges and progress tracking.

- **Personalized Learning Resources**  
  Based on the problems solved and individual progress, the platform suggests additional resources and learning materials to help students improve their coding skills further.

- **Feedback Mechanism**  
  SPARK incorporates a feedback feature that allows students to share their experiences and challenges. This input helps improve the AI suggestions and overall platform experience.
